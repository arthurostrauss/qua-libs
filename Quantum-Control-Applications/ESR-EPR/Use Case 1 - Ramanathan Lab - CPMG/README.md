_Important note: The code in this folder is the exact code that was used for running the dynamical decoupling protocol, 
and it is tailored for a very specific setup and software environment. Thus, the code is only for inspiration._

## The goal
The goal of this experiment is to obtain the decay time of spin-echo amplitudes in the decoherence of an electron 
spin ensemble due to irreversible stochastic magnetic-field-fluctuations surrounding the spins using the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill
pulse sequence. 

## The device
It consists of an ensemble of spins next to Nitrogen-Vacancies (NV).
