## The goal

In this use-case we show data related to the stabilization of a Kerr-Cat qubit with
a squeezing drive and three wave mixing.

## The device
The device that was used was as SNAIL with a planar resonator for readout, and
both of these inside of a 3D cavity.

## Kerr-cat qubit

The Kerr-cat Hamiltonian is the following in the frame rotating at the SNAIL frequency $\hat{H}_{cat}/\hbar = -K\hat{a}^{\dagger2}$

where K is the Kerr-nonlinearity and The simulated energy landscape can be seen in Fig. 1c. There are two local minima
separated by an energy barrier. The two coherent states existing in these minima are $\alpha$
