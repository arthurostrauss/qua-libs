The features of a double quantum dot can be revealed through a two dimensional sweep of the left and right barriers. The left barrier will be coupled strongly to the left dot, therefore, by increasing its voltage holes will be force out of the dot to the leads. Each of these charge transitions will be reflected in a shift of the charge sensor. The same is equally true for the right barrier and the right dot. 

If a double dot is present a two dimensional sweep over both the left and right barrier voltages should promote charge transitions in both dots, thus revealing the characteristic double dot charge stability diagram.
